# Minecraft AMP
A dockerfile for using the Minecraft module of the AMP server management program, by CubeCoders. This Dockerfile is based on Alpine linux, meaning it is only a few megabytes in size!

## Environment Variables
This Dockerfile requires a CubeCoders licence, specified as the environment variable LICENCE. An example run command for this Dockerfile is:

```docker run --rm -ti -e "LICENCE=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" -p 8080:8080  -p 25565:25565 -v /volumes/amp:/ampdata adamant/minecraft-amp```

This dockerfile also support more environment variables to customise the minecraft servere parameters. These are:
* **HOST** - Specifies the interface AMP and the minecraft server should listen on
* **PORT** - The port for the AMP webUI
* **USERNAME** - The default username for logging into the webUI
* **PASSWORD** - The default password for logging into the webUI
* **INSTANCE_NAME** - The name of the instance AMP needs to create. Should not need to be changed.

These environment variables can either be defined at runtime, as LICENCE has above, or in a file. For information on how to format and use this file, see the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#/set-environment-variables-e-env-env-file).
